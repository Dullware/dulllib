**** CarlosAg Excel Xml Writer Library is NOT part of Dullware ****


From http://www.carlosag.net/tools/excelxmlwriter/

This library allows you to generate Excel Workbooks using XML, it is built 100% in C# and does not requires Excel installed at all to generate the files. It exposes a simple object model to generate the XML Workbooks.
It supports several features for generating Excel Workbooks including:

    Formatting
    Alignment
    Formulas
    Pivot Tables
    and more...


Note: This library is free, you can distribute it and use it at your own will and risk, it is not supported by any company including Microsoft or any other company, it does not belong to any company.

There are many commercial tools to generate Excel workbooks, including SoftArtisans ExcelWriter.
My tool has nothing to do with any of those.
This tool was written entirely in C#, by Carlos Aguilar Mares.


**** From the FAQ ****

Is it free? Yes, it is free, you don't need to pay anything to use it. If you want I would appreciate mention the site so people can find it.
